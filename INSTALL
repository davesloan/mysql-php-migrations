3) Make sure you have a valid username/password for your MySQL database server
   and have already created the database on which you will be performing
   migrations against.

4) On the command line, run the following and answer the prompts:
   ./migrate.php init

For a list of commands and how to use them, run:
./migrate.php help

directory.  You will need to edit this to make changes specific to your 
installation.
